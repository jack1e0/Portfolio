        About Me

        Hi, I’m Jackie — a Computer Science student at the National University
        of Singapore with a deep passion for building and creating. My journey
        began with a background in art and design, which evolved into a love for
        technology. Today, I combine both worlds by designing and developing
        products that are not only functional but also meaningful and enjoyable
        for others.
        <br />
        <br />
        This year, I embarked on NUS Overseas College (NOC) in Stockholm, which
        is an incredibly valuable opportunity, allowing me to immerse in the
        local start-up ecosystem, as well as hone my technical skills as a
        software developer at Kisi, where I’m contributing to real-world
        projects and learning from an innovative team.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of tech, I’m an avid backpacker and hiker. I love exploring new
        places and perspectives — something that continues to shape both my
        personal growth and creative approach to problem-solving.
